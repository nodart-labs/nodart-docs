The framework adheres to the concept of "just install and use". 
Everything you need to run a server application:

1. **Templating**
2. **Working with a session**
3. **ORM client, Working with databases (MySQL, PostgresSQL, SQLite, MSSQL, OracleDB, CockroachDB, Amazon Redshift)**
4. **Error and Exception handling**
5. **Working with a command line; Creation of custom commands**
6. **Routing**
7. **Custom events and states**
8. **Dependency injection**
9. **Observer pattern**
10. **Repository pattern**

Everything of this is provided out of the hood. 
All that is needed for some of the above things to work is to specify the basic settings 
in the configuration file. 

The framework provides a very flexible architecture, 
making it easy to extend and customize all of these things, 
up to and including completely changing the basic behavior 
by specifying class loaders and references in the same configuration file.
